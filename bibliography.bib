    abstract      = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

Although the multi-modality framework allows for the integration of complementary information, there are many challenges to overcome, including targets with different energy returns, and information loss due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or due to dependent measurements from different sensors that are not appropriately processed. We develop the particle filter (PF) based recursive track before detect (TBD) algorithm for joint RF-EO tracking to avoid loss of information caused by matched filter thresholding at low SNR. A waveform optimization technique is integrated into the PF-TBD to allow for adaptive waveform selection. We also approximate distributions of parameters of dependent RF and EO measurements using the embedded exponential family (EEF) approach to further improve target detection and tracking performance.},
